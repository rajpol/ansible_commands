#ansible mysql -m service -a "name=mysql state=restarted"


You can also use the service module to stop a service:


#ansible mysql -m service -a "name=mysql state=stopped"


Alternatively, you can also use the service module to start a service:


#ansible mysql -m service -a "name=mysql state=started"
